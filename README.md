# ZMP support areas for multi-contact mobility under frictional constraints

Source code for http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03232

## Abstract

We propose a method for checking and enforcing multi-contact stability based on
the Zero-tilting Moment Point (ZMP). The key to our development is the
generalization of ZMP *support areas* to take into account (a) frictional
constraints and (b) multiple non-coplanar contacts. We introduce and
investigate two kinds of ZMP support areas. First, we characterize and provide
a fast geometric construction for the support area generated by valid contact
forces, with no other constraint on the robot motion. We call this set the
*full support area*. Next, we consider the control of humanoid robots using the
Linear Pendulum Mode (LPM). We observe that the constraints stemming from the
LPM induce a shrinking of the support area, even for walking on horizontal
floors. We propose an algorithm to compute the new area, which we call
*pendular support area*. We show that, in the LPM, having the ZMP in the
pendular support area is a necessary *and sufficient* condition for contact
stability. Based on these developments, we implement a whole-body controller
and generate feasible multi-contact motions where an HRP-4 humanoid locomotes
in challenging multi-contact scenarios.

## Installation

On Ubuntu 14.04, you will first need to [install
OpenRAVE](https://scaron.info/teaching/installing-openrave-on-ubuntu-14.04.html).
Next, install other required dependencies by:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cython python python-dev python-pip python-scipy python-tk
sudo pip install pycddlib quadprog
```

Next, you will need to install the
[contact\_stability](https://github.com/stephane-caron/contact_stability) ROS
package. Link it into your Catkin workspace and build. The installation is successful if
you can run ``roslaunch contact_stability all.launch`` without error. Finally, clone the
repository with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/stephane-caron/tro-2016
```

  III of the paper)
- [motion\_editor](motion_editor/) for the motion generation framework (Section
  V) based on the Pendular Support Area (Section IV)
- [n\_moment\_point](n_moment_point/) for the n-Moment Point (Appendix A)
